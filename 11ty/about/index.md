## Backstory

Self-Defined exists on the principle that we define our words, and they do not define us. The goal of this project is an inclusive, holistic dictionary in which the definitions of the words are ever-changing and reflect the world in which we live. 

There are many dictionaries available in the world; however, those dictionaries are often written by centred and majority people. This means that the definitions within those dictionaries are often weaponized and used to refute the opinions of minority and marginalized people who never had a hand in the writing of the definition. For example, a white person defining the word "racism," and then using this definition of to explain racism to a marginalized person, who then has to perform extraordinary emotional labor in order to define the term appropriately.

Furthermore, words and their definitions are powerful. We use them to convey and describe our identities and foster conversations, as well as materialize concepts, create policies, and define infrastructure. 

Self-Defined is successful if it allows us to acknowledge this power, change our definitions where appropriate, and supports greater, more nuanced understanding and tolerance of fellow humans through words.

## Notes on language 

Since language is at the core of Self-Defined, we want to make a couple of acknowledgments.  

First, language is fluid. It can change for many reasons: 

* New inventions beget new words. Languages evolve to describe things which didn't exist before. For example, the word "blog."
* As we learn from other people, other experiences, and are exposed to new ways of speaking, our own languages are shaped by that. English does this often with loanwords. 
* Old words can acquire new meanings. For example, the word "nice" used to mean "silly" or "foolish."

As a result, we may have definitions on Self-Defined that are out of date, and may not have kept up with the times. Please let us know, and we'll work to correct it (or if you'd like to contribute the definition, please do)! 

Second, self-identifying terms **do not always have concensus**. However,  we are not looking for concensus on these words. We are looking for those for whom the term applies to find the definition inclusive and accurate. 

## Content warnings

Reading this site may be triggering for some folks. We've tried to care for that by placing content warnings around the site to appropriately warn about the material.

We've also tried to add a note to the word definition page that warns folks who may use the word elsewhere about its implications. That is, the use of a word may elicit negative feelings and visceral reactions like panic and trauma, so we provide guidance on using content warnings outside of Self-Defined. 

### Open-source

This project is open-source. That means that you can view its source code here on Github, contribute, and modify it. The process and the history of this project is freely available. 

Self-Defined is built on Eleventy, a static site generator. All tools we use will also be part of the open-source ecosystem. 

### Usage and licensing

Self-Defined uses the [GNU AGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) license. You may build on our project, but you cannot profit from it. 

## Future plans

The roadmap in the future includes but isn't limited to: 

1. A **dictionary site**/webapp where words can be connected, linking to alternates for bad terms or alternates for definitions with nuance. This would include the ability to use parameters, so that someone can connect multiple words they use together, to help clear up how they define themselves. For example, ?disabled+pan+Indigenous. Creating such a strand easily would allow people to link in email signatures, Twitter bios, etc.
3. A **Twitter bot** that could be tagged in order to provide the definition of a word. For example '@SelfDefinedBot define racism.' This relieves the emotional labor that marginalized people often perform in defining words for others. 
4. A **Slack bot** for the flagging of problematic words and providing alternates for these words. This could also define words at the user's request. 
5. A **custom API**, which would allow the dictionary to be adapted and referenced under other large-scale projects.
